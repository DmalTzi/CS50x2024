sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: I try to run sorted50000.txt and this file is faster than sort1, because if data is sorted complexity is O(n)

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: I know this first because when I run this file all data's file, this file is faster and complexity this algorithm is O(n log n), that mean this is merge sort is faster than bubble and selection

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: The last one, this algorithm slowest than all algorithm and complexity is O(n^2)
